# Backend - Note Taking App CRUD API

## Project Overview

This backend project entails creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for a note-taking application. The API will interact with a database to manage notes effectively.

## Objectives

- Develop a Node.js backend using TypeScript.
- Implement CRUD operations for note management.
- Choose and integrate any database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
- Ensure code quality, structure, and API reliability.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Setup**: Clone the backend branch. Use `npm install` to set up your environment.
2. **Database**: Select a database of your choice and integrate it with your application.
3. **Task**: Build CRUD endpoints for managing notes. Aim for clarity, efficiency, and robustness.
4. **Testing**: Write tests for your API endpoints to ensure they work as expected.
5. **Submission**: Submit a pull request with a detailed account of your approach, challenges, and solutions.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality of CRUD operations.
- Code quality and use of best practices.
- Choice of database and integration quality.
- Completeness and reliability of tests.
- Documentation of API endpoints.
