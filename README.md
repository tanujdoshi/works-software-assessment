# Shiftkey Works Software Assessment Repository

Welcome to the Shiftkey Works Software Assessment Repository! This repository is designed to evaluate the skills of candidates applying for frontend, backend, and full-stack roles within our team. Below you will find instructions on how to contribute to the repository, complete assessments, and submit your work for review.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Begin by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will allow you to work independently on the assessment.

2. **Choose Your Assessment Path**: Decide which role you are applying for:
   - **Frontend**: If you're interested in the frontend role, focus on the `frontend` branch which contains a React JS setup.
   - **Backend**: For backend roles, switch to the `backend` branch, where you'll find a Node.js TypeScript setup.
   - **Full Stack**: If you're applying for a full-stack position, you'll need to complete tasks in both branches to showcase your versatility.

3. **Read Branch-Specific Instructions**: Each branch contains detailed instructions for the assessment. Make sure to read these carefully to understand the scope and requirements of the task.

## Contributing

After selecting your path and familiarizing yourself with the tasks, it's time to start coding. Here's how to submit your work:

1. **Complete the Assessment**: Work on the tasks outlined in the branch related to your chosen role. Ensure your solution is polished and meets all stated requirements.

2. **Create a Pull Request**: Once you've completed the assessment, create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to the respective branch (`frontend` or `backend`) of the main repository. For full-stack applicants, you may need to create two separate PRs for each branch.

3. **Describe Your Contribution**: In your PR, provide a detailed description of what you've accomplished, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them. Include a link to a working demo of your solution, if possible.

4. **Feedback and Questions**: Should you encounter any difficulties or have questions during the assessment, feel free to reach out to us:
